# Quicksort Algorithm in Rust

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the quicksort algorithm. Quicksort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements in an array.

## Algorithm Explanation

The quicksort algorithm works as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If the array has fewer than two elements, return the array as it is already sorted.
2. **Choosing a Pivot**: Select the first element of the array as the pivot.
3. **Partitioning**: 
   - Create two new arrays: `less` for elements less than or equal to the pivot, and `greater` for elements greater than the pivot.
   - Iterate through the remaining elements of the array and populate the `less` and `greater` arrays accordingly.
4. **Recursion**: Recursively apply the quicksort algorithm to the `less` and `greater` arrays.
5. **Concatenation**: Concatenate the sorted `less` array, the pivot, and the sorted `greater` array to form the final sorted array.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Average case: O(n log n)
  - Worst case: O(n^2)

- **Space Complexity**: O(log n)

Note: Quicksort has a smaller constant than merge sort. So if theyâ€™re both O(n log n) time, quicksort is faster. And quicksort is faster in practice because it hits the average case way more often than the worst case.
